  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>"I’m a Bachelor of Technology student specializing in Data Science,
  but I live at the intersection of logic and design. As a Full-Stack
  Web Developer, I build everything from robust backend systems to 
  responsive digital experiences; as an Artist, I capture life in 
  charcoal. Whether I’m architecting a database, fine-tuning a CSS
  layout, or sketching a portrait, my work is driven by an obsession 
  with detail."</p>
